## Overview
I used a supervised classifcation model for this project, in order to sort the wines into two categories: red or white. This involved me importing the data, performing an analysis, then cleaning, scaling, and modeling the data.

## Goals
My goal was to create a model that can accurately determine if a wine is white or red.

## Motivation & Background
I was interested in this because, I personally, am not a huge fan of wine. In a blind taste test I probably would not be able to tell white from red, so I was curious to see if this model could figure out what I cannot using the data it is given!

## Data
I downloaded this dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/numberswithkartik/red-white-wine-dataset?select=wine_dataset.csv). The set contains data on thousands of wines. The columns include Fixed Acidity, Volatile Acidity, 	Citric Acid,	Residual Sugar,	Chlorides,	Free Sulfur Dioxide,	Total Sulfur Dioxide,	Density	pH,	Sulphates, Alcohol,	Quality, and Style.
